Simmons            includes many common spaces on the first floor that are intended            to welcome our colleagues from across campus and our neighbors from            the Cambridge community. The Residential Scholars program is meant            to enrich all of MIT with fresh ideas and perspectives brought to            us by people who have had a wealth of life experiences that they            are eager to share with the community. The program is populated mostly            by faculty members on sabbatical leave from other institutions, artists,            industry professionals visiting MIT and a limited number of MIT faculty            members who have shown, by a long history of contributions to the            community, a reason to participate in this program. The program is            based in Simmons Hall but services the entire community.</p>          <p>The Scholars, working with the permanent House Team, typically run            programs on Friday evenings. Since its inception in 2003, the financial            resources to support the program primarily have been provided by            the scholarly allowance associated with the William and Betsy Leitch            Professorship, which is held by John Essigmann, one of the Housemasters            of Simmons Hall. The community is indebted to the Leitchs for their            generous support of this program.</p>          <h2>Become a Residential Scholar!</h2>          <p>Residential Scholars are professors, artists, and professionals            with a visiting appointment at MIT, who live in Simmons Hall as part            of our community.
